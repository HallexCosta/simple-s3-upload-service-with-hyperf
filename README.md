# Introduction

This is simple application upload and delete images to AWS S3 with Hyperf.

# Requirements

Hyperf has some requirements for the system environment, it can only run under Linux and Mac environment, but due to the development of Docker virtualization technology, Docker for Windows can also be used as the running environment under Windows.

The various versions of Dockerfile have been prepared for you in the [hyperf/hyperf-docker](https://github.com/hyperf/hyperf-docker) project, or directly based on the already built [hyperf/hyperf](https://hub.docker.com/r/hyperf/hyperf) Image to run.

When you don't want to use Docker as the basis for your running environment, you need to make sure that your operating environment meets the following requirements:  

 - PHP >= 8.1
 - Any of the following network engines
   - Swoole PHP extension >= 5.0，with `swoole.use_shortname` set to `Off` in your `php.ini`
   - Swow PHP extension >= 1.3
 - JSON PHP extension
 - Pcntl PHP extension
 - OpenSSL PHP extension （If you need to use the HTTPS）
 - PDO PHP extension （If you need to use the MySQL Client）
 - Redis PHP extension （If you need to use the Redis Client）
 - Protobuf PHP extension （If you need to use the gRPC Server or Client）

# Getting started

Once installed, you can run the server immediately using the command below.

```bash
php bin/hyperf.php start
```

Or if in a Docker based environment you can use the `docker-compose.yml` provided by the template:

```bash
docker compose up -d
docker exec -it api01 composer install
docker exec -it api01 php bin/hyperf.php start
```

This will start the cli-server on port `9501`, and bind it to all network interfaces. You can then visit the site at `http://localhost:9501/` which will bring up Hyperf default home page.

## Hints

- Take a look at `config/routes.php` and `app/Controller/IndexController.php` to see an example of a HTTP entrypoint.
